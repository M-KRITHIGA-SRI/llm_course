Week 4: Dataset Generation and Storage

The project now includes a dataset generation system that creates realistic Ragnarok Online items with the following attributes:
- Item Name
- Item ID
- Item Description
- Item Price (in zeny)
- Item Type
- Willing to Trade For status

The datasets are stored in CSV format in the `week4/data` directory, with each file containing a timestamped version of the items. The latest dataset is always available as `ragnarok_items_latest.csv`.

The dataset generation uses the Mistral-7B-Instruct model to create diverse and realistic items with appropriate attributes and prices. This data will be used by an LLM agent to:
1. Understand item values and relationships
2. Suggest fair trades between players
3. Calculate appropriate zeny amounts for partial trades
4. Consider item rarity and demand in trade suggestions

The next phase will involve creating an LLM agent that can:
- Load and process the generated datasets
- Understand player trade requests
- Suggest optimal trade combinations
- Consider market value and item rarity
- Provide explanations for trade suggestions
