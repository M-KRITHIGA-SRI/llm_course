    "\n",
    "Before starting, you should have completed the setup for [PC](../SETUP-PC.md) or [Mac](../SETUP-mac.md) and you hopefully launched this jupyter lab from within the project root directory, with your environment activated.\n",

    "## If you're new to Jupyter Lab\n",
    "\n",
    "Welcome to the wonderful world of Data Science experimentation! Once you've used Jupyter Lab, you'll wonder how you ever lived without it. Simply click in each \"cell\" with code in it, such as the cell immediately below this text, and hit Shift+Return to execute that cell. As you wish, you can add a cell with the + button in the toolbar, and print values of variables, or try out variations.  \n",
    "\n",
    "I've written a notebook called [Guide to Jupyter](Guide%20to%20Jupyter.ipynb) to help you get more familiar with Jupyter Labs, including adding Markdown comments, using `!` to run shell commands, and `tqdm` to show progress.\n",

    "If you'd prefer to work in VSCode, [here](https://chatgpt.com/share/676f2e19-c228-8012-9911-6ca42f8ed766) are instructions from an AI friend on how to configure it for the course.\n",

Rather, I execute Jupyter Labs, like this, and give you an intuition for what's going on. My suggestion is that you carefully execute this yourself, <b>after</b> watching the lecture. Add print statements to understand what's going on, and then come up with your own variations. If you have a Github account, use this to showcase your variations. Not only is this essential practice, but it demonstrates your skills to others, including perhaps future clients or employers...</span>\n",

We'll do fun things like have LLMs tell jokes and argue with each other. But fundamentally, my goal is to teach skills you can apply in business. I'll explain business implications as we go, and it's worth keeping this in mind: as you build experience with models and techniques, think of ways you could put this into action at work today. Please do contact me if you'd like to discuss more or if you have ideas to bounce off me.</span>\n",

Located just a short distance from Covent Garden, Euston station, Westminster and Paddington mainline, these beautiful apartments offer easy accessibility to numerous amenities in central London. We have two units available at Malden Road, one of which is a furbishtone and the other is also pet-friendly for maximum comfort. We believe investing your money in these properties can yield incredible returns over time. If you're interested, scheduling a viewing or asking questions are both perfectly fine by us. Alternatively, if you prefer to remain anonymous, please don't hesitate to let me know, and I will remove you from our database. In the meantime, here are a couple of more details about Malden Road:\n",
      "\n",
      "Malden Road is one of London's most affluent streets, having undergone staggering regeneration over recent years. Today it boasts prestigious architecture and impeccable design, making it appealing to both residents and the city's leading businesses. As for Kings Avenue, you can expect the same kind of excellent living experience here, with its proximity to Ealing's vibrant West London neighborhood. The apartment is furnished; however, additional items (like sofa sets, armchairs, etc.) aren't provided separately. This unit also has the benefit of 24-hour management and maintenance support that ensures you have free rein on your desired living conditions. At last but not least, if you happen to be in search of a pet-friendly property within reach of central London, Malden Road is an ideal option for you - no dog-sitting required.
