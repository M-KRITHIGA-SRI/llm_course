      "We will keep support of TF and Flax with v4 as LTS (~mid 2026). This change marks the beginning of v5!\n",
      "\n",
      "We have heard the feedback about transformers being bloated with many layers of abstraction. \n",
      "\n",
      "With this, we expect to remove 50% of the code from the library. This will contribute to removing abstraction layers; aligned with our focus on simplification:\n",
