Providers. What has changed since V3? Here\\'s my quick home experiment 👇 \\n\\nDeepSeek silently dropped an update to V3 yesterday. Benchmark results are available, showing significant improvements over V3. \\n\\nStill, it is always a good idea to run new models on data you care about and see more detailed, fine-grained results.\\n\\nNow that we can all run these new models from Day 0 with no GPUs required, I wanted to share my approach with an example I created this morning:\\n\\n1. I got a sample from the LIMA dataset (containing high-quality general instructions).\\n2. Run the instructions with V3 and the new version V3-0324.\\n3. Define and run a simple judge with Llama3.3-70B to compare the model responses.\\n4. Push the dataset and pipeline so you can check and run similar experiments! (see first comment)\\n5. Extracted the results with\\nHugging Face\\nData Studio.\\n\\nResults summary\\n- LIMA is not very challenging, but it is still interesting to see the differences between the two models.\\n- A majority of Ties indicate that both models are close for this domain and task.\\n- But still, V3-0324 consistently wins over V3 (33 times vs 6 times).\\n\\nAs usual, the dataset, prompts, and pipeline are open-source (see first comment).\\n\\nWhat other experiments you\\'d like to see?\\n214\\n7 Comments\\nLike\\nComment\\nShare\\nHugging Face\\nreposted this\\nGradio\\n60,769 followers\\n4d\\nReport this post\\nStarVector is a multimodal vision-language model for generating SVG (Scalable Vector Graphics). 👇 \\n\\nIt can be used to perform image2SVG and text2SVG generation.
