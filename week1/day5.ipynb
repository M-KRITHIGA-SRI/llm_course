      "Join us\n",
      "Our Purpose\n",
      "We believe AI will have a vast impact on the world. Anthropic is dedicated to building systems that people can rely on and generating research about the opportunities and risks of AI.\n",
      "We Build Safer Systems\n",
      "We aim to build frontier AI systems that are reliable, interpretable, and steerable. We conduct frontier research, develop and apply a variety of safety techniques, and deploy the resulting systems via a set of partnerships and products.\n",
      "Safety Is a Science\n",
      "We treat AI safety as a systematic science, conducting research, applying it to our products, feeding those insights back into our research, and regularly sharing what we learn with the world along the way.\n",
      "Interdisciplinary\n",
      "Anthropic is a collaborative team of researchers, engineers, policy experts, business leaders and operators, who bring our experience from many different domains to our work.\n",
      "AI Companies are One Piece of a Big Puzzle\n",
      "AI has the potential to fundamentally change how the world works. We view ourselves as just one piece of this evolving puzzle. We collaborate with civil society, government, academia, nonprofits and industry to promote safety industry-wide.\n",
      "The Team\n",
      "We’re a team of researchers, engineers, policy experts and operational leaders, with experience spanning a variety of disciplines, all working together to build reliable and understandable AI systems.\n",
      "Research\n",
      "We conduct frontier AI research across a variety of modalities, and explore novel and emerging safety research areas from interpretability to RL from human feedback to policy and societal impacts analysis.\n",
      "Policy\n",
      "We think about the impacts of our work and strive to communicate what we’re seeing at the frontier to policymakers and civil society in the US and abroad to help promote safe and reliable AI.\n",
      "Product\n",
      "We translate our research into tangible, practical tools like Claude that benefit businesses, nonprofits and civil society groups and their clients and people around the globe.\n",
      "Operations\n",
      "Our people, finance, legal, and recruiting teams are the human engines that make Anthropic go. We’ve had previous careers at NASA, startups, and the armed forces and our diverse experiences help make Anthropic a great place to work (and we love plants!).\n",
      "Our Values\n",
      "01\n",
      "Here for the mission\n",
      "Anthropic exists for our mission: to ensure transformative AI helps people and society flourish. Progress this decade may be rapid, and we expect increasingly capable systems to pose novel challenges. We pursue our mission by building frontier systems, studying their behaviors, working to responsibly deploy them, and regularly sharing our safety insights. We collaborate with other projects and stakeholders seeking a similar outcome.\n",
      "02\n",
      "Unusually high trust\n",
      "Our company is an unusually high trust environment: we assume good faith, disagree kindly, and prioritize honesty. We expect emotional maturity and intellectual openness. At its best, our trust enables us to make better decisions as an organization than any one of us could as individuals.\n",
      "03\n",
      "One big team\n",
      "Collaboration is central to our work, culture, and value proposition. While we have many teams at Anthropic, we feel the broader sense in which we are all on the same team working together towards the mission. Leadership sets the strategy, with broad input from everyone, and trusts each piece of the organization to pursue these goals in their unique style. Individuals commonly contribute to work across many different areas.\n",
      "04\n",
      "Do the simple thing that works\n",
      "We celebrate trying the simple thing before the clever, novel thing. We embrace pragmatism - sensible, practical approaches that acknowledge tradeoffs. We love empiricism - finding out what actually works by trying it - and apply this to our research, our engineering and our collaboration.

      "How We Hire\n",
      "The interview process at Anthropic varies based on role and candidate, but our standard process looks like this:\n",
      "Step 1\n",
      "Resume\n",
      "Submit your resume via our website.\n",
      "Step 2\n",
      "Exploratory chat\n",
      "You’ll have a chat with one of our staff to discuss your career interests and relevant experience, and learn more about Anthropic.\n",
      "Step 3\n",
      "Skills Assessment\n",
      "For technical roles, you’ll have a one-hour technical screening interview.\n",
      "For operations or policy roles, you’ll get a take-home assignment. These typically involve writing responses to several role-relevant questions; they may occasionally require some outside research. Assignments usually take between 2-5 hours, depending on the role.\n",
      "We include this to minimize bias and make well-informed hiring decisions. We think seeing a candidate’s work helps us assess how they might actually perform on the job; similarly, the assignment gives candidates a better idea of what their work at Anthropic might entail. If a candidate likes working through their take-home, that is one indicator that they would enjoy taking on the role, and vice versa.\n",
      "We recognize that completing work assignments requires time and effort, and that they are not perfectly reflective of the role’s work. Nonetheless, we think that work tests are a useful complement to interviews and reference checks.\n",
      "Step 4\n",
      "Team Screen\n",
      "You'll have a conversation with either the Hiring Manager or a member of your potential team.\n",
      "Step 5\n",
      "Interview Panel\n",
      "For technical roles, you’ll have 3-4 more one-hour technical interviews, plus a culture interview.\n",
      "For operations or policy roles, you’ll have 3-5 hours of interviews, including a culture interview.\n",
      "Step 6\n",
      "Final Checks\n",
      "We’ll ask for some references, and have you chat with our leadership.\n",
      "Step 7\n",
      "Offer\n",
      "We’ll make you an offer!\n",
      "Technical Interviews\n",
      "Technical interviews at Anthropic are broadly categorized into ‘engineering’ or ‘research’ interviews, and each candidate is given a mix tailored to their skillset.\n",
      "Engineering interviews are usually carried out in a shared Python coding environment, like Google Colab. Frontend engineering interviews are in JavaScript. They have the form:\n",
      "Here’s a description of a component from our stack. Could you re-implement a toy version of it for me in one hour?\n",
      "These components are ‘chunkier’ than the more common LeetCode problems, and are intended to mimic the day-to-day of engineering at Anthropic.\n",
      "We are particularly interested in your thought process and how you attack the problem. You’ll be allowed to look things up with Google, but it’s still important to be familiar with Python syntax and the standard library. We primarily code in Python, and a common reason candidates fail interviews is that they're not fully comfortable in Python.\n",
      "Only one of our engineering interviews touches on machine learning topics, and you can ask to pass on that one if you wish. You do not need to learn anything about machine learning before interviewing as an engineer at Anthropic.\n",
      "Research interviews are broader in form. They’ll include some engineering interviews, and some discussions about the kinds of systems we study.\n",
      "Both the research and engineering interview process also include softer questions about your experience and motivations, and time to ask us about Anthropic.\n",
      "Other Things\n",
      "Engineers here do lots of research, and researchers do lots of engineering\n",
      "While there’s historically been a division between engineering and research in machine learning, we think that boundary has dissolved with the advent of large models. The distribution of candidates we interview is strongly bimodal in both engineering and research experience however, and we have necessarily tailored our interview structure to that.\n",
      "If you’ve an engineering background, please apply as an engineer. You’ll perform much better in the interviews, and if you join you’ll have as much input to Anthropic’s direction and interests as anyone else.\n",
      "As evidence towards this: all of our papers have engineers as authors, and often as first author. Research and engineering hires all share a single title - ‘Member of Technical Staff’.\n",
      "We value direct evidence of ability\n",
      "If you’ve done interesting independent research, written an insightful blog post, or made substantial contributions to open-source software, put that at the top of your resume!\n",
      "Feedback\n",
      "We do not provide feedback on resumes or interviews.\n",
      "Visas\n",
      "Anthropic sponsors visas! We aren't able to sponsor them for every role and every candidate; operations roles are especially difficult to support. But if we make you an offer, we will make every effort to get you into the United States, and we retain an immigration lawyer to help with this.\n",
      "Green cards\n",
      "Once you’re eligible, we’re also keen to sponsor green cards!\n",
      "We do not require PhDs, degrees, or previous ML experience\n",
      "About half of Anthropic technical staff have a PhD of some sort; about half had prior experience in ML. We have several brilliant colleagues who never went to college.\n",
      "Remote interviewing\n",
      "All our interviews are conducted over Google Meet. We prefer PST office hours, but we can be flexible if that’s difficult for you.\n",
      "Re-applying\n",
      "Similarly, if interviews don’t work out this time, you’re welcome to re-apply after 12 months, and earlier if something materially changes about your experience or skills.\n",
      "Remote work\n",
      "Anthropic staff all come to the office regularly. Most staff live in the Bay Area, though a few live further away and come in for one week a month. We also understand that moving can take time, so as a transitional phase some folks start while fully remote.\n",
      "Offer timing\n",
      "If we make an offer, we’re happy to give you time to think about it and finish up any other interview processes you’re going through.\n",
      "Internships\n",
      "We do not offer internships.\n",

      "Our story\n",
      "Building on our past. Ready for the future.\n",
      "We started out as a small engineering consultancy in Australia more than 50 years ago. We’re proud of who we are and where we’ve come from. So instead of leaving our past behind, we’re building on our credibility as an engineering partner in energy, chemicals and resources to become a solutions provider leading partners and societies to a more sustainable future.\n",
      "Right now, we’re bridging two worlds as we accelerate to more sustainable energy sources, while helping our customers provide the energy, chemicals and resources that society needs now.\n",
      "And we’re delivering sustainable change as we help our customers meet global demand while driving innovation and sustainability across our projects.\n",
      "Our journey is marked by decades of change, adaptation and growth. As the world has evolved, so have we.\n",
      "Here's our story\n",
      "Welcome to today's Worley, and a moment that's pivotal in our history. Our new brand direction represents our commitment to leading the energy transition, driving change, and making a lasting impact. It also reflects our past, and the values and ambitions that propel us towards a future where sustainability and innovation define everything we do.\n",
      "2010s\n",
      "The 2010s witnessed the rise of clean energy, streaming services, the first full face transplant and the widespread adoption of electric vehicles.\n",
      "For us it was about consolidating our global position, as we made pivotal acquisitions including Jacobs Energy, Chemicals and Resources, diversified our capabilities, and committed to energy transition and sustainability.\n",
      "2000s\n",
      "The 2000s were marked by the rise of social media, the invention of the smartphone, and the development of the first self-driving car.\n",
      "Meanwhile, we were strengthening our commitment to sustainability, expanding across Africa, the Middle East and Canada and celebrating our public listing on the Australian Securities Exchange.\n",
      "1990s\n",
      "The 1990s saw the rise of the internet, the invention of the digital camera, and the launch of the Hubble Space Telescope.\n",
      "It was also the decade we expanded our global presence, acquiring companies in Canada and the United States. And established ourselves as a key player in the global engineering and consultancy services industry.\n",
      "1980s\n",
      "The 1980s were all about big hair, neon colors, Crocodile Dundee, the discovery of the hole in the ozone layer, and the first mobile phone.\n",
      "Back then, we were focused on expanding our services and global footprint, playing a crucial role in the North West Shelf Gas project, which marked our entry into the world energy market.\n",
      "1970s\n",
      "The 1970s were a time of disco, bell-bottoms, the invention of the first personal computer, and the official opening of the iconic Sydney Opera House.\n",
      "We began our journey, as a small engineering consultancy in Australia, laying the foundation for what would see us become a global leader in engineering solutions.\n",

      "Andy Loose\n",
      "Global Vice President – LNG\n",
      "“35 years working in the energy industry has given me deep and varied knowledge. It’s rewarding to share that with others and drive our growth strategy for LNG.”\n",
      "Andy has over three decades of experience in the energy industry, with the last 18 years dedicated to the global\n",
      "liquefied natural gas\n",
      "(LNG) sector.\n",
      "“Throughout my career, I’ve focused on engineering and delivering cryogenic plants – starting with CO\n",
      "2\n",
      "liquefaction and air separation plants, before moving into LNG,” he says. “I specialized in process engineering, then transitioned into technical and project management roles.\n",
      "“In my current role, I help drive our global growth strategy for the LNG sector and support our business development leads to pursue new opportunities. I also provide subject matter expertise to our project and consultancy teams, particularly in LNG project delivery, which is rewarding.”\n",
      "A technology neutral approach to LNG project development\n",
      "Andy believes LNG will remain a key part of the energy transition. He explains how this is shaping the work we’re delivering.\n",
      "“LNG is a key component of our customers’ growth strategies,” he says. “However, LNG projects are complex developments. It takes considerable time and effort to reach a positive investment decision, and many fail along the way.\n",
      "“Our extensive experience in complex global LNG projects allows us to guide and support our customers on the long journey from concept, through execution, to operations. As we are technology neutral, we offer truly independent advice during concept selection to deliver the optimum solution.”\n",
      "Reducing the carbon intensity of new LNG projects\n",
      "But lowering the carbon intensity of the LNG value chain will be vital to maintaining social license of new gas and LNG projects. Andy explains.\n",
      "“I expect the global LNG demand to peak sometime in the 2030s. This makes the carbon intensity of operating plants an increasingly important factor, as suppliers and buyers aim to meet their climate goals and comply with more stringent emissions regulations.\n",
      "“That means there’s work to be done now, both for LNG projects in the concept stage and operating plants,” Andy adds. “We provide tailored solutions for our customers’ decarbonization efforts, identifying and quantifying emissions across the production part of the value chain.\n",
      "“We’ve developed a new tool that accurately determines the carbon intensity of facilities and benchmarks them against industry standards and best practices. This enables us to identify opportunities for emissions reduction through carbon capture, renewable power electrification, and methane leakage reduction.\n",
      "“Our role is to implement the most efficient and financially viable solutions for our customers, so they can succeed in a lower carbon world.”\n",

      "project delivery\n",
      "and respond to changing industry dynamics.\n",
      "“I lead strategic initiatives to foster long term partnerships with key customers. To drive innovation, sustainability, and value creation through transformational project and portfolio delivery and a commitment to environmental and social responsibility,” says Sevi.\n",
      "“The mining industry is grappling with engineering, construction, or financial challenges at the same time.\n",
      "“And as a partner to large miners, we need to overcome the misconception that we solely provide\n",

      "From mathematics to future facing commodities\n",
      "Sevi’s career trajectory has helped her to understand the range of challenges faced by our mining customers.\n",
      "“Being a mathematician, it wasn't straightforward to pinpoint a profession from the outset,” says Sevi.\n",
      "“I had to delve into diverse experiences early in my career. My exploratory years spanned various roles in oil and gas, financial services, and power utilities, where I honed skills in data storytelling to inform decision making and effectively manage stakeholders.”\n",
      "Sevi then moved into early leadership roles in mining, delivering organization wide strategic business plans, opportunity assessments and early studies.\n",
      "“This helped me understand how large and complex organizations work, and how to develop strategies at a scale,” she adds.\n",
      "The next phase of Sevi’s career involved more substantial leadership roles, where she managed large teams, spearheaded organizational transformations, and fostered a culture of learning and innovation.\n",
      "“Over the past 10 years, I’ve held senior and executive global leadership roles with a focus on future facing commodities, energy transition, sustainably improving whole-of-business outcomes and the integration of emerging technologies.”\n",
      "Balancing financial and production goals with sustainability targets\n",
      "Sevi is optimistic about the mining industry’s ability to transform in years, rather than decades.\n",
      "“I’m fortunate to work with people who can deliver the scale of change needed to extract full value from materials while reducing environmental impacts,” she says.\n",
      "“Our team brings expertise across environment and social, sustainability, procurement and construction, program management, and digital innovation.\n",
      "“Mining plays a vital role in facilitating the energy transition by providing essential materials for renewable energy technologies, ensuring supply chain resilience, fostering innovation, and contributing to economic development.\n",
      "“I’m confident that with a shift in how we approach partnerships, innovation and a commitment to sustainability, the mining industry can pave the way for a more sustainable and resilient future.”\n",

      "“The levels of innovation and\n",
      "first of a kind solutions\n",
      "across the industry excites me.”\n",
      "Mervyn’s career spans over 30 years, with experience working across production, engineering, projects and technology development around the world. But for the last 10 years, his focus has shifted to the global battery materials industry.\n",
      "“I’ve always wanted to make a difference through my work. And rarely do you have the chance to contribute to something as meaningful as the global energy transition,” he says.\n",
      "Mervyn joined Worley in 2018, and recently relocated to the\n",

      "South Africa\n",

      "“I provide technical input and oversight into process engineering in mining, minerals and metals, battery materials and related technologies. And working at the cutting edge of the resources industry means no two days are ever the same.”\n",
      "The shift from social license to social license to operate\n",
      "The energy transition is driving the global demand for battery materials. But as production increases, social license to operate is becoming a challenge for producers.\n",
      "“Social license to operate is driving permitting decisions for projects, particularly for the management of CO\n",

      "emissions, water stewardship and waste management,” he explains.\n",
      "And Mervyn expects this to increase in the future.\n",
      "“Regulations will become more stringent and will impact how we generate, store and consume energy. Fabrication and production industries will evolve to accommodate these changes and more efficient recycling processes will be a growing focus.”\n",
      "Inadequate sulphate waste plans are causing project delays\n",
      "However, for battery active material (BAM) producers and battery recyclers, this has become a challenge.\n",
      "“During the production and recycling process for lithium batteries, sodium sulphate – a waste byproduct – is often created in large quantities. With limited demand in consumable products such as detergents the excess has been dispatched as waste and ended up in landfill or been deposited into large bodies of water. But these are no longer acceptable solutions,” he says.\n",
      "“BAM projects are facing growing delays due to inadequate sulphate waste management plans. And new entrants into the BAM market should aim to eliminate it from their processes completely.”\n",

      "The future of battery active materials projects\n",
      "Mervyn insists while the challenge remains, technology advancements mean solutions do exist.\n",
      "“Sodium sulphate production as a byproduct has increased due to the production of refined intermediates for battery precursors, battery materials and battery recycling. But it is avoidable,” he says.\n",
      "“Our technology neutral approach allows us to provide the solutions needed to help address these challenges. And it’s rewarding to spend my workdays helping our BAM customers around the world to future proof their operations, so they can capitalize on growing global demand for batteries.”\n",

      "“Every project is different, so each day brings a new problem to solve,” Carola smiles. “But the common thread is that a sustainable water management strategy should be both robust and adaptable. The climate is changing, sustainability expectations are growing, and our mining customers need to maintain their\n",

      "A career spanning four continents\n",
      "Carola’s career began in\n",
      "Chile\n",
      ", but she wasn’t immediately drawn to the water field.\n",
      "“I got my chemical engineering degree followed by a degree in environmental studies,” she says. “And my first job was as a process engineer in the paper and pulp industry.\n",
      "“I then relocated to Austria, working for the Institute of Sustainable Waste Management at the Mining University of Leoben,” Carola continues. “Before moving to\n",
      "Australia\n",
      "to work as an assistant researcher for the flocculation group at the Centre for Multiphase Processes, University of Newcastle.”\n",
      "During her time in Australia, Carola developed an interest in\n",
      "water issues in mining\n",
      ".\n",
      "“Flocculation is about separating solid particles from a liquid, which has a big impact on how responsible miners are with water,” she explains. “I knew from that point I wanted to help miners make better use of water. And I’ve worked on projects across\n",
      "North America\n",
      "and Latin America ever since.”\n",
      "Embracing the challenge of the water-energy nexus\n",
      "Carola has a unique perspective on the challenges South American miners are facing.\n",
      "“Water supply, transportation and treatment requires a lot of energy,” she explains. “But I see a future where the trade-offs between water and energy are less prominent.\n",
      "“Every mining project in a water stressed region should include plans to reduce water consumption through reuse, recycle and recovery,” Carola continues. “The other piece is decarbonizing the energy needed to source water for processes, using renewable sources like\n",
      "solar\n",
      "and\n",
      "wind\n",
      ".\n",

      "Senior Technical Consultant\n",
      "“Throughout my career, I’ve worked in a variety of industries helping to develop more\n",
      "sustainable processes\n",
      "for products or technologies.”\n",
      "Daniel is part of our Technology and Expert Solutions team, based in Stockton,\n",
      "UK\n",
      ". He uses his technology and innovation experience to deliver front end studies for our customers working in, or looking to enter, the battery materials sector.\n",
      "“I work with our customers to develop new battery flowsheets and assess alternative technologies, from raw material processing through to battery recycling,” says Daniel.\n",
      "“The battery materials industry is going through rapid innovation. Working with companies that are generating ideas that can have a long lasting impact on the world is an enjoyable challenge to face each day.”\n",
      "Technology is advancing but sodium sulphate is a growing concern\n",
      "The battery material industry has been around for a long time. But for Daniel the exciting part of being in this industry now is that the technology has caught up with customers’ needs.\n",
      "“This is particularly important when it comes to supporting greenfield battery active material projects,” he says.\n",
      "“When building on a greenfield site there’s always a concern from investors about the environment impact. And sodium sulphate, the waste by-product of battery active materials (BAM) production, is a growing roadblock for producers and investors.\n",
      "“A standard lithium-ion cathode active material plant produces more sodium sulphate than it does battery materials,” he explains.\n",
      "“There are technologies that can convert this waste into higher valuable products for use in a range of different industry sectors. But they require energy, which costs money. It’s a huge challenge. And until the economics are favorable it’s likely there will be stockpiles of sodium sulphate crystals looking for a market.”\n",
      "New projects must remove sodium sulphate production entirely\n",
      "Daniel believes it’s critical for new entrants into the industry and new projects, to remove sodium sulphate production from their processes altogether to avoid eventual delays and pushback further down the line.\n",
      "“Sodium sulphate free processes are key for next generation battery material facilities,” he explains. “And the good thing is these processes already exist and with further developments could become common place.”\n",
      "“Working on greenfield BAM plants is about starting with a clean slate and being able to design processes that fit the circular economy and will last for decades without harming the environment.”\n",

      "“We’re not waiting for the perception of mining to change. We\n",
      "’re\n",
      "working with our customers to develop new solutions to\n",
      "optimize their operations\n",
      "and enable their transition to more sustainable practices.”\n",
      "Richard Fiorante works as a Senior Director in our Autonomous Americas team for\n",
      "Worley Consulting\n",
      ". Richard has more than 25 years of experience in the oil and gas and mining industries. And today, he helps transform mining operations by creating autonomous solutions.\n",
      "“\n",
      "The future of mining\n",
      "depends on technology for a smarter, safer, and more sustainable operations,” says Richard. “We help our customers meet future demand for resources – while making progress on their\n",
      "sustainability\n",
      "goals – by developing and implementing autonomous solutions such as robotics, artificial intelligence (AI), data analytics and simulation.\n",
      "“A challenge in my role is identifying when and how to apply technologies to drive value as early as possible,” Fiorante explains. “Mining companies need to evaluate and integrate technologies at the beginning of the project lifecycle, while also looking for optimization opportunities throughout the life of a project.”\n",
      "The importance of collaboration in mining\n",
      "Early in his career, Richard recognized the potential of technology to transform operations across various industries. This passion has driven him to work closely with customers to develop new solutions for mining operators.\n",
      "“I believe that collaboration and partnering with customers is critical to progress in our industry,” explains Richard. “By building open and transparent relationships, we can achieve sustainable growth together.”\n",
      "One example is maintaining transparent reporting of environmental performance, which ensures stakeholders have a clear understanding of the operational impact of a mine.\n",
      "“Optimizing resource use and preventing waste simplifies decision making and accelerates the initiation of mining operations,” he says. “Our commitment to innovation extends to machine learning algorithms and AI, enabling us to optimize resource extraction, minimize environmental impact, and make more accurate predictions for sustainable exploration strategies in\n",
      "America\n",
      ".”\n",
      "Automation at the heart of operational optimization\n",
      "As Richard explains, there is an urgent need for more efficient and cost effective ways to explore and recover the\n",
      "critical minerals\n",
      "needed to support the energy transition.\n",
      "“Technologies like remote sensors, IoT (internet of things) devices, and\n",
      "advanced automation\n",
      ", allow miners to continuously collect data which allows them to\n",
      "make informed decisions\n",
      "in near-real-time, in remote locations. This can help to optimize exploration, enhance safety, and reduce downtime.\n",
      "“This must be supported by seamless connectivity, enabled by telecommunications infrastructure, and comprehensive cybersecurity measures to safeguard against cyber threats and protect sensitive operational data,” continues Richard.\n",
      "“Our approach has four pillars: real-time simulations, early-stage asset identification, digital data driven operations and advanced automation.\n",
      "“Through this approach, we’re not just shaping the future of mining with our customers, by ensuring continued social license to operate and increasing output, we’re also building a legacy of responsible mining practices.”\n",
