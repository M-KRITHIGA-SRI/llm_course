      "He began his career in 2008 at Erdemir Mining Company as a Mining R&D Engineer, part of Oyak Mining Metallurgy Group in Divriği, Turkey. Early on, he worked on geophysical gravity and magnetic iron ore exploration and learned Surpac software to create 3D solid models from drill data. He enhanced his skills in Geostatistics through training at Hacettepe University.\n",
      "With this expertise, he created block models and conducted reserve classifications, improving the company’s cost-efficiency and profits. He played a key role in discovering new fields and developing existing reserves, contributing to significant financial gains.\n",
      "In 2020, he joined Tosyalı Iron Steel Angola, a subsidiary of Tosyalı Holding, in Jamba, Angola. He continued reserve classifications using Datamine software and discovered new iron and gold fields. He also mentored junior engineers by providing Datamine training.\n",
      "Software has always been his passion, starting in high school and continuing throughout his career. He pursued courses in web development, mobile app development, cybersecurity, and data science, eventually discovering his true passion for data science. He took a career break to intensively train in this field, and continues to learn and work on projects daily.\n",
      "Key Achievements\n",
      "Discovered iron ore deposits totaling more than 300 million tons across multiple sites.\n",
      "Applied AI-driven approaches to his work, boosting efficiency.\n",
