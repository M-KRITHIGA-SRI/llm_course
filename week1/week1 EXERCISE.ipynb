       "Example:\n",
       "python\n",
       "books = [\n",
       "    {\"title\": \"1984\", \"author\": \"George Orwell\"},\n",

       "python\n",
       "{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "\n",
       "- **Purpose:** Builds a set of all `\"author\"` values found in the `books` listâ€”ignoring any books without an `\"author\"` (i.e., where `book.get(\"author\")` is `None` or falsy).\n",
       "- **How it works:**\n",
       "  * `book.get(\"author\")`: Tries to fetch the \"author\" value; returns `None` if not present.\n",
       "  * `if book.get(\"author\")`: Includes only those books with a non-empty, truthy \"author\".\n",
       "  * The `{ ... for ... if ...}` makes a **set comprehension**. Sets automatically filter out duplicatesâ€”so you'll get **unique author names** only.\n",

       "\n",
       "The given code snippet is a Python expression that uses a combination of generator expressions, `yield from`, and dictionary methods to extract authors from a list of books. Here's a breakdown:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. `{book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}`:\n",
       "   - This is a **generator expression**, which is similar to a regular list comprehension but returns an iterator instead.\n",
       "   - The expression iterates over the `books` list and yields values for each item that passes the condition `if book.get(\"author\")`.\n",
       "   - If an item doesn't have a key named \"author\", it will be skipped.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. `yield from {book.get(\"author\") ...}`:\n",
       "   - This is where things get interesting.\n",
       "   - The `yield from` keyword in Python 3.3+ allows you to delegate the iteration over another iterable (in this case, the generator expression).\n",
       "   - When `yield from` is encountered, the current function pauses and yields values from the specified iterable.\n",
       "\n",
       "So, when we put it all together:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "```\n",
       "\n",
       "This code snippet essentially creates a new iterator that produces authors one by one. For each book in `books` where an author is found, its value (or the author's name) will be yielded.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Why use this?**\n",
       "\n",
       "Using generator expressions and `yield from` achieves several benefits:\n",
       "\n",
       "*   Memory efficiency: Instead of storing all the values in memory at once, we create an iterator that yields one item at a time. This makes it suitable for handling large datasets.\n",
       "*   Flexibility: Generator expressions can be used to perform more complex transformations on data than regular list comprehensions or for loops.\n",
       "\n",
       "**Example Use Case**\n",
       "\n",
       "Suppose you're building an application where you need to process a large number of books and their authors. You could use the provided code snippet as part of your processing pipeline:\n",
       "\n",
       "```python\n",
       "def extract_authors(books):\n",
       "    yield from {book.get(\"author\") for book in books if book.get(\"author\")}\n",
       "\n",

       "for author in extract_authors(books):\n",
       "    print(author)\n",
       "```\n",
