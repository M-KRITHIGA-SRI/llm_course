    "\n",
    "Here's the scoop:\n",
    "\n",
    "The python class `OpenAI` is simply code written by OpenAI engineers that makes calls over the internet to an endpoint.  \n",
    "\n",
    "When you call `openai.chat.completions.create()`, this python code just makes a web request to the following url: \"https://api.openai.com/v1/chat/completions\"\n",
    "\n",
    "Code like this is known as a \"client library\" - it's just wrapper code that runs on your machine to make web requests. The actual power of GPT is running on OpenAI's cloud behind this API, not on your computer!\n",
    "\n",
    "OpenAI was so popular, that lots of other AI providers provided identical web endpoints, so you could use the same approach.\n",
    "\n",
    "So Ollama has an endpoint running on your local box at http://localhost:11434/v1/chat/completions  \n",
    "And in week 2 we'll discover that lots of other providers do this too, including Gemini and DeepSeek.\n",
    "\n",
    "And then the team at OpenAI had a great idea: they can extend their client library so you can specify a different 'base url', and use their library to call any compatible API.\n",
    "\n",
    "That's it!\n",
    "\n",
    "So when you say: `ollama_via_openai = OpenAI(base_url='http://localhost:11434/v1', api_key='ollama')`  \n",

      "Let me try to break down the term \"neural network.\" Neural network makes me think of neurons from my biology classes, which have connections and produce signals when activated. So maybe it's a similar system that processes information? I think neural networks do something like pattern recognition or make predictions based on data. But how exactly does that work?\n",

      "Moving on to attention and transformers. The user mentioned that attention mechanisms are inspired by how neurons perceive light, so they detect specific features near each object in an image. I think the brain does something like this when looking at images or videos, focusing on certain details more than others.\n",

Transformers seem different to me because I know they have words with 'ar-' like \"arc\" or \"adjust.\" Maybe it's related to time series data? Or perhaps something with attention but in a different way, like encoding and decoding sequentially.\n",

      "\n",
      "2. **Attention Mechanisms**: These mechanisms enable neural networks to focus on specific features of the data by simulating how the brain emphasizes certain elements over others in visual data.\n",
