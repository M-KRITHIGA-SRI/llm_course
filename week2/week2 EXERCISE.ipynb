       "The color of the sky is primarily determined by the way sunlight interacts with Earth's atmosphere. During the daytime, the sky appears blue because of a phenomenon called Rayleigh scattering. Sunlight is made up of different colors, each with different wavelengths. Blue light has shorter wavelengths and is scattered in all directions by the gases and particles in the atmosphere more than other colors with longer wavelengths. This scattered blue light reaches our eyes from every direction, making the sky look blue.\n",
       "\n",
       "At sunrise and sunset, the sky can appear red or orange because the sunlight passes through a thicker layer of the atmosphere, scattering shorter wavelengths out of our line of sight and allowing longer wavelengths like red and orange to dominate.\n",
       "\n",
       "At night, the sky appears black because the sun is below the horizon, and its light does not directly illuminate the atmosphere above us. Without sunlight to scatter, there is no blue light to color the sky. Instead, we see the darkness of space punctuated by stars and other celestial objects.\n",
       "\n",
       "In summary, the blue color of the daytime sky is due to the scattering of sunlight by the atmosphere, while the black color at night results from the absence of direct sunlight and the vast emptiness of space beyond Earthâ€™s atmosphere."
